# Fluid
Fluid Simulation based on Daniel Schiffman's coding challenge 134, which is based on Mike Ash's masters's thesis on fluid simulation. Fluid simulation is a combination of particle system with perlin noise flow field. The code has minor changes e.g. additional color attributes for particles which are being passed on to add_density function for three color density arrays.
