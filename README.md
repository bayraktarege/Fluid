# Fluid
Fluid Simulation based on Daniel Schiffman's Coding Challenge #134, which is based on Mike Ash's masters's thesis on fluid simulation. Fluid simulation is a combination of particle system with perlin noise flow field adapted from Dan Shiffman's Coding Challenge #24. The code has minor changes e.g. additional color attributes for particles which are being passed on to add_density function for RGB density arrays of the fluid class.
